## Requirements
* Xcode 5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 6.0 or higher
* ARC

## Demo

Build and run the `REFrostedViewControllerExample` project in Xcode to see `REFrostedViewController` in action.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

The recommended approach for installating `REFrostedViewController` is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.
For best results, it is recommended that you install via CocoaPods >= **0.23.0** using Git >= **1.8.0** installed via Homebrew.

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Change to the directory of your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
```

Edit your Podfile and add REFrostedViewController:

``` bash
platform :ios, '6.0'
pod 'REFrostedViewController', '~> 1.0.1'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

Please note that if your installation fails, it may be because you are installing with a version of Git lower than CocoaPods is expecting. Please ensure that you are running Git >= **1.8.0** by executing `git --version`. You can get a full picture of the installation details by executing `pod install --verbose`.

### Manual Install

All you need to do is drop `REFrostedViewController` files into your project, and add `#include "REFrostedViewController.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.

## Example Usage

``` objective-c
self.menuViewController = [[REFrostedViewController alloc] init];
[self.menuViewController presentFromViewController:self animated:YES completion:nil];
```

## Customization

You can customize the following properties of `REFrostedViewController`:

``` objective-c
@property (strong, readwrite, nonatomic) UIColor *blurTintColor;
@property (assign, readwrite, nonatomic) CGFloat blurRadius;
@property (assign, readwrite, nonatomic) CGFloat blurSaturationDeltaFactor;
@property (assign, readwrite, nonatomic) CGFloat threshold;
@property (assign, readwrite, nonatomic) NSTimeInterval animationDuration;
```
